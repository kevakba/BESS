Hypotehsis:
	Can we predict electricity price from solar, wind and demand prediction?

Model Training: 
	Data:
		actual demand: have a python script which fetch actual and predicted alberta_internal_load data on hourly basis
		actual electricity price: have a python script which fetch actual & predicted price data on hourly basis
		actual solar production:
		actual wind production:

Model Inferencing:
	demand:
		accurately being predicted for next 24 hours

	electricity price:
		
	supply:
		solar: accurately being predicted for next 24 hours
		wind: accurately being predicted for next 24 hours

download data for Dec 2024
train ML model to predict price using variables solar, wind and demand
